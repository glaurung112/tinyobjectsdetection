# Small Particle Detection and Counting Project

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the *Small Particle Detection and Counting* project, led by Professor Marvin Coto Jiménez. This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect and count small particles in images using machine learning techniques.

In this repository, you will find the project description, objectives, and guidelines to help you get started. The repository is intended to be forked by students, who will then add their own code to implement solutions for the tasks outlined.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a system capable of counting small particles in images. The project involves applying machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques to detect and quantify the particles.

Key tasks include:

1. **Literature Review** – Researching current methods for small object detection in images.
2. **Dataset Analysis** – Reviewing and preparing the provided dataset for training.
3. **Model Implementation** – Implementing and training a machine learning model (e.g., CNN, YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluating the model’s performance using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Thresholding and Detection** – Fine-tuning the detection thresholds based on particle size, quantity, and image contrast.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork this repository to your own GitHub account to start working on the project.
2. **Implement the Solution:** Add your own code for image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You will need to:
   - Preprocess the dataset for model training.
   - Implement a machine learning model (CNN or advanced models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN).
   - Evaluate the performance of your model and refine it.
3. **Dataset:** The dataset required for this project is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daenys2000/small-object-dataset/data).
4. **Deliverables:** Your completed work should be uploaded to this repository, including:
   - Dataset generated
   - Model training code
   - Evaluation metrics and results
   - A final report documenting your approach and results
